## 12-factor app

Certainly! Let's dive deeper into each of the 12 factors that define the principles of a 12 Factor App. These factors were initially outlined by Heroku and have become a widely adopted set of guidelines for building cloud-native applications that are scalable, maintainable, and suitable for modern DevOps practices.
1. Codebase
• One Codebase: Each application should have a single codebase tracked in version control (e.g., Git). This ensures consistency across environments and simplifies collaboration among developers.
• Multiple Deploys: Different instances of the application can be running from the same codebase, differing only in configuration.

2. Dependencies
• Explicit Dependencies: Dependencies such as libraries and frameworks should be explicitly declared and isolated. Use tools like package managers (npm, pip) to manage dependencies, avoiding reliance on system-wide packages.
• Versioned Dependencies: Ensure dependencies are versioned to maintain consistency across different environments and deployments.

3. Config
• Store Configuration in the Environment: Configuration details (like database credentials, API keys) should be stored in environment variables, not hardcoded in the application's codebase.
• Separate Config from Code: This separation of configuration from code enhances security, facilitates easier deployment across different environments (dev, test, prod), and allows for configuration changes without code modifications.

4. Backing Services
• Treat Backing Services as Attached Resources: Backing services (databases, caching systems, message brokers) are external resources that the application consumes via network endpoints.
• Easily Replaceable: Backing services should be replaceable and swappable with minimal effort. The application should not be tightly coupled to a specific service provider or implementation.

5. Build, Release, Run
• Strict Separation of Build, Release, and Run Stages: Clearly define and automate these stages:
◦ Build: Convert the codebase into an executable artifact.
◦ Release: Combine the build artifact with configuration to create a deployable release.
◦ Run: Execute the application in a production-like environment.
• Build Artifacts: Use automated tools and scripts to generate consistent and reproducible build artifacts for deployment.

6. Processes
• Execute the Application as Stateless Processes: Applications should be stateless and share-nothing. Any required state should be stored in a stateful backing service (like a database).
• Horizontal Scaling: Applications should be able to scale horizontally by adding more instances of stateless processes to handle increased load.

7. Port Binding
• Export Services via Port Binding: Applications should export services (like HTTP endpoints) via port binding. Use a port number (e.g., 80 for HTTP) to make services accessible externally.
• Self-Contained: Each application instance should be self-contained and able to run independently on its designated port.

8. Concurrency
• Scale Out via the Process Model: Applications should scale out horizontally by adding more concurrent processes (stateless instances).
• Parallel Execution: Leverage the process model to handle concurrent requests efficiently and distribute the workload.

9. Disposability
• Maximize Robustness with Fast Startup and Graceful Shutdown: Applications should start up quickly and shut down gracefully. Use process managers or container orchestrators to manage lifecycle events effectively.
• Recovery: Fast startup and shutdown enhance application robustness and facilitate quick recovery from failures or deployment changes.

10. Dev/Prod Parity
• Keep Development, Staging, and Production Environments Similar: Aim to minimize differences between environments to reduce deployment risks and ensure consistency.
• Use of Automation: Implement continuous integration and deployment (CI/CD) practices to automate testing, deployment, and configuration management across environments.

11. Logs
• Treat Logs as Event Streams: Applications should generate logs as event streams, writing them to standard output (stdout). Use centralized logging systems for aggregation, monitoring, and analysis.
• Diagnostic Tool: Logs serve as a valuable diagnostic tool for troubleshooting issues, performance monitoring, and auditing.

12. Admin Processes
• Run Administrative Tasks as One-Off Processes: Administrative tasks (like database migrations, data import/export) should be automated and executed as separate, temporary processes.
• Isolated Execution: Perform administrative tasks within the application's production environment to maintain consistency and ensure proper execution.

Summary
The 12 Factor App principles provide a comprehensive framework for developing cloud-native applications that are scalable, resilient, and easy to manage. By adhering to these principles, teams can build applications that leverage modern DevOps practices such as automation, continuous deployment, and infrastructure as code (IaC). Each factor addresses specific aspects of application development, deployment, and operation, aiming to maximize agility, reliability, and maintainability in cloud environments.
